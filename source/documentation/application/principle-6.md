## 6. Application independence

### Description

Applications should, as much as possible, be independent in terms of the technology they
are consumed on and should be able to operate on a variety of technology platforms.

### Rationale

Independence of applications from the underlying technology allows applications to be developed, upgraded and operated in the most cost effective and timely way. Otherwise technology, which is subject to continual obsolescence and vendor dependence, becomes the driver rather than the user requirements themselves.

Realising that every decision made with respect to IT makes us dependent on that technology, the intent of this principle is to ensure that application software is not dependent on specific hardware and operating software.

Exit strategies should be implemented when considering a technology, facilitating an agnostic approach that may change if the service needs change.

### Implications

This principle will require standards which support portability.

For Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) applications, there may be
limited current choices, as many of these applications are technology and platform-dependent.

Subsystem interfaces will need to be developed to enable legacy applications to interoperate with applications and operating environments developed under the enterprise architecture.

Middleware should be used to decouple applications from specific software solutions.
