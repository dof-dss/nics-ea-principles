## 2. Align with the Enterprise Architecture

### Description

Enterprise Architecture begins with the enterprise’s strategies, objectives, its business
outcomes and business capabilities. Therefore, applications whether developed in-house or
purchased, must respect the provisions of the Enterprise Architecture’s future state.

A convergence with the enterprise architecture’s future state takes place as new applications are built, new technologies are implemented, and older systems are updated or decommissioned. Exceptions to theenterprise architecture might be supported for specific cases if there is a consensus that the benefits of using a solution from a specific technology exceed those arising from the adoption of the enterprise architecture. In some cases, this may trigger a review of the future state architecture to include the exception if this is deemed as desirable.

### Rationale

Alignment offers several advantages:
- It allows the enterprise architecture to evolve and accommodate changes in processes and technologies
- It avoids conversions of obsolete systems, which are extremely expensive
- Over time, it preserves the investment while promoting the benefits of the enterprise architecture.

### Implications

- Delayed convergence could reduce the benefits of the enterprise architecture.
- Convergence requires a realistic and tangible approach to migration to the enterprise architecture.
- It requires an explicit transition strategy for current systems after the target technology is identified.
- Allows decommissioning a system sooner when that is appropriate.
- Convergence does not allow waiting indefinitely. It requires a business case for exceptions, an exception process, and an exit strategy. It must establish temporary or permanent exceptions, as well as exitstrategies for temporary exceptions.
- Convergence requires sponsorship to replace obsolete technologies.
