## 3. Apply Enterprise Architecture Principles to externally provided or hosted applications

### Description

As new outsourcing contracts and agreements are entered into, they must adhere to the
NICS enterprise architecture principles where applicable.

This is one of the ways to keep enterprise architecture in line with the business. Outsourced activities must not be exceptions to the enterprise architecture simply because they are outsourced. Outsourced solutions must be evaluated against these principles, including Intellectual Property rights.

### Rationale

To be successful, enterprise architecture must be integrated with key phases of IT project delivery: concept, planning, including procurement of solutions.

### Implications

This requires partnerships and efficient communication between business, procurement, contract management, and business areas to get the benefits offered by the enterprise architecture.

- IT acquisitions must include requirements based on the enterprise architecture.
- The investment vision for the business must include IT requirements.
- Information technology acquisitions must include requirements based on the enterprise architecture.
- Where external IT providers are contracted to build solutions on behalf of NICS, the Intellectual Property Rights must be the property of NICS.
