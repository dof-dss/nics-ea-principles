## 7. Component reusability

### Description

The enterprise architecture is built over low-coupling, reusable, modular components
that implement services. Systems architecture must be as simple as possible to maintain
yet meet all business and NICS requirements. Whenever complexity is required, it must
be encapsulated to promote simplicity of solutions built on the architecture.

### Rationale

Reusable components represent opportunities to reduce development times and costs. Reusable components
leverage investments in current systems. Modular components increase the systems’ capacities to adapt to different evolution needs, because the change is isolated from affected modules.

### Implications

- Standards and guidelines to develop reusable system components should be compiled
- Application maintenance must be prioritised along with new development work
- Application’s maintenance may be driven by decisions that deem a technology to be no longer supported within the enterprise
- Failure to maintain applications must be recognised as a risk to that application and all systems that depend on/consume the application
