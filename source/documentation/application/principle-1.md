## 1. Design simple and easy to use applications

### Description

The enterprise architecture is built with reusable, modular components that
implement services.

Solution architecture must be as simple as possible to maintain yet meet business requirements. Whenever complexity is required, it must be encapsulated to promote simplicity of solutions defined by the architecture.

The business community acknowledges the ease of use of its technology solutions. The technology is
transparent as it enables the business to concentrate on tasks, rather than system operation issues.

### Rationale

Reusable components represent opportunities to reduce development time and costs. Reusable components
leverage investments in current systems. Modular components increase the systemsâ€™ capacities to adapt todifferent evolution needs, because the change is isolated from affected modules.

The more that users need to understand the technology employed, the less productive they will be. The ease of use concept is a positive reinforcement for promoting simplicity in design. It encourages individuals to work within the integrated information environment rather than developing isolated systems to perform tasks outside of the integrated NICS environment. Most of the knowledge required to operate systems is very similar.
Formatting is limited to a minimum, and system misuse risks are low.

### Implications

- The architecture establishes standards and guidelines to develop system components.
- All applications must have the same appearance and layout as much as possible. Thus, a standard layout must be developed and usability testing criteria must be implemented by the QA organization.
- Feedback loops should be established as a priority during any development effort to help guide and gather factual data about how successful work efforts are in achieving the desired outcome and in particular, the ease-of-use of the application.
