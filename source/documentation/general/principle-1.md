## 1. The architectural principles will apply to all business areas within the NICS

### Description

Use the business alignment perspective to make information management decisions
and aim to generate maximum value for the NICS as a whole.

### Rationale
Decisions based on an NICS perspective and its priorities have greater long-term value than decisions based
on a certain perspective of individual business areas with a specific interest. An optimal Return on Investment
requires decisions to be aligned with NICS priorities and positioning.

The only way NICS will be able to provide a consistent and measurable level of appropriately robust, reliable,
sustainable services and quality information to decision-makers, is if all stakeholders abide by the NICS
overarching principles for its technology, information and business architectures.

### Implications

Optimal NICS benefits requires changes in how information and technology is planned and managed.
Technology alone is not enough to promote such changes.

This principle will ensure inclusion, consistency, fairness and continual alignment to the business.  Without this
the management of our technologies, information and business processes would be quickly undermined.

Business Partners engaging with the business will work to find accommodation between interested parties
around any conflicts with a principle relevant to the proposal.
