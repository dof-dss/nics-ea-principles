## 6. Deliver maximum benefits at the lowest cost and risks

### Description

Strategic decisions for solutions must always strive to generate value for the NICS
enterprise as a whole, at the lowest long-term risks and costs.

### Rationale

Decisions must not be made based solely on reaching lower solution costs. Every strategic decision must be assessed based on cost, risk, and benefit perspectives through a sound business case. Lower costs often represent greater risks, lower quality and, perhaps, fewer benefits. Decisions must provide maximum benefit to
 he whole NICS enterprise in order to maximise benefit to citizens.

### Implications

- A solution must be selected based on an assessment of the qualitative or quantitative cost (ROI), its risk, and its business benefits.
- Most times, quantitative assessments are simpler based on a cost perspective but more complex for risks and even more intricate for benefits. The quantitative assessment must always be conducted whenever possible as it is a more tangible.
- A qualitative assessment of one or two perspectives is generally sufficient when a quantitative assessment is properly conducted and already leads to a decision.
- Operating risks must be quantified whenever possible.
- The technology infrastructure must also be optimised based on business requirements and technological capacity to generate lower costs and risks, thus benefiting the NICS.
- We will need to balance the portfolio of projects to include higher risk/reward initiatives at in an effort to ensure continued innovation.
- Achieving maximum enterprise-wide benefit will require changes in the way we plan and manage
information - technology alone will not bring about this change.
- Some organisations may have to concede their own preferences for the greater benefit of the entire
enterprise.
- Application development priorities must be established by the entire enterprise for the entire enterprise.
- Applications components should be shared across organisational boundaries.
- Information management initiatives should be conducted in accordance with the enterprise plan.
- Individual organisations should pursue information management initiatives which conform to the
blueprints and priorities established by the enterprise.
