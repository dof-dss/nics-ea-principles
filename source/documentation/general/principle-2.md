## 2. Include business continuity into planning and decision making

### Description

Define and maintain a set NICS processes and activities that can be invoked in the event
of interruptions always keeping business continuity top of mind.

### Rationale

The rise in cyber-attacks, the rapidly changing technical landscape and an increased dependency on technology
means that the NICS faces uncertainty and change. Consequently, we must ensure business critical activities
are able to continue to function despite internal and external events. We must apply a risk/ impact analysis to
our decision making and planning to ensure potential issues are planned for. As a result, specific organisational
alternative mechanisms will be required to manage these unexpected risks and their impacts.

### Implications

Dependence on shared applications implies that business interruption risks must be expected and managed
in advance. Management includes, but is not limited to, periodic revisions, vulnerability and exposure tests, or
designing business critical services to ensure continuity through redundancies or alternative resources.

- Enterprise operations are maintained regardless of any system interruptions
- National Cyber Security Centre and the Security Policy Framework must be followed.
- Risk and impact analysis must be included within planning and decision making.
- Recoverability, redundancy, and maintenance must be approached at inception.
- Applications must be assessed regarding criticality and impact on the NICS to determine which continuity
level is required and which corresponding recovery plan must be implemented.
- Business resumption plans must be part of the overall business continuity strategy.
- Dependency on shared system applications mandates that the risks of business interruption must be
established in advance and managed.
- Management includes but is not limited to periodic reviews; testing for vulnerability and exposure; or
designing mission-critical services to ensure business function continuity through redundant or alternative
capabilities.
- Recoverability, redundancy, and maintainability should be addressed at the time of design.
- Applications must be assessed for criticality and impact on the NICS mission statement in order to
determine what level of continuity is required and what corresponding recovery plan is necessary.
- Metrics surrounding availability, operational and service level agreements must be mandated as part of the
design process.
