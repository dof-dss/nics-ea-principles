## 4. Reuse before buy, buy before build

### Description

Avoid duplicating effort and unnecessary costs by collaborating across government and
sharing and reusing technology, data and services. Prior to acquiring new assets, the
NICS will reuse applicable existing information and technology assets. If no existing
internal asset is available for reuse, the preference is to acquire, by purchasing or
licensing, applicable externally available assets. The NICS least preferred option is to
custom build a new asset.

### Rationale

Reusing information and technology assets (for example, automated systems or data) that are already available
is often the simplest, quickest, and least expensive solution, assuming that the assets in question sufficiently
fit the intended purpose. It is less expensive to buy standard technology solutions than to custom build them,
as long as they are not adapted and maintenance is left to the product supplier. Many authoritative data
sources make their data products available (or offer data acquisition/generation services), reducing the need to
generate such data. Custom development of assets is often very expensive to sustain.

### Implications

When functionality is required, existing information and technology assets in the NICS must be evaluated and
used first, unless they do not exist and/or are a significant mismatch to the required functionality. The NICS must have a unified approach to:

- Identifying the business functions that are allowed to differ from industry standard practices in using NICS assets and commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions and determining the extent to which these functions are allowed to be different.
- To ensure that information and technology assets are being reused as much as possible, business areas must be prepared to adapt to existing solutions that provide adequate functionality, particularly in situations where the accountable governance body does not deem that business areaâ€™s practices to be required to be different from industry standard practices.
- The NICS will prefer COTS products and particularly those that are configurable. Some products are so configurable that there is little difference between extensive configuration and custom development. NICS must clearly understand when configuration equates to custom development (that is, the level of configuration is so high that the COTS solution is essentially the same as custom development). In these cases, the scenario will change from buy to build.
- Agreements or licenses to use data (i.e. data subscription services) may have legal implications and legal consultation should be part of the process of deciding to use a new data source.
- Information and Technology assets should only be custom developed as a last resort. That is, custom
development should be prevented as much as possible.
- NICS must be able to manage the life cycle of its IT assets, including its custom assets, and custom assets should be revisited periodically during their life cycle, to allow for reconsideration in case the custom asset should be replaced with an appropriate purchased alternative.
- The complexity of the integration effort will increases as the environment becomes more diversified with solutions that made available on-premise (internally developed or COTS) as well as externally hosted.
- Unnecessary diversity in information and technology assets and approaches to technology business
solutions must be minimized.
- Service catalogues must be maintained to ensure widespread awareness of the existing assets (data,
applications, services, APIs etc), their health and lifecycle status
