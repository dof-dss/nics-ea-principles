# General Principles

## 1.1 - The architectural principles will apply to all business areas within the NICS

#### Description

Use the business alignment perspective to make information management decisions
and aim to generate maximum value for the NICS as a whole.

#### Rationale
Decisions based on an NICS perspective and its priorities have greater long-term value than decisions based
on a certain perspective of individual business areas with a specific interest. An optimal Return on Investment
requires decisions to be aligned with NICS priorities and positioning.

The only way NICS will be able to provide a consistent and measurable level of appropriately robust, reliable,
sustainable services and quality information to decision-makers, is if all stakeholders abide by the NICS
overarching principles for its technology, information and business architectures.

#### Implications

Optimal NICS benefits requires changes in how information and technology is planned and managed.
Technology alone is not enough to promote such changes.

This principle will ensure inclusion, consistency, fairness and continual alignment to the business.  Without this
the management of our technologies, information and business processes would be quickly undermined.

Business Partners engaging with the business will work to find accommodation between interested parties
around any conflicts with a principle relevant to the proposal.

- Business areas initiatives must align to the NICS IT Strategy and the NICS Enterprise Architecture.
- As new needs arise, priorities must be adjusted. The Information Technology Design Authority must make
these decisions.
- Information Technology Design Authority will make prioritisation decisions.
- Information management initiatives should be conducted in accordance with the enterprise plan.
- Individual organisations should pursue information management initiatives which conform to the
blueprints and priorities established by the NICS.
- Information and Technology cost management must focus on services allowing the business areas to
effectively deliver their mandate.
- Information and Technology management must assess its performance against key indicators in alignment
with business performance objectives.
- Some business areas might need to waive their specific preferences to benefit the NICS as a whole.
- Application development priorities must be established by and for the entire NICS.
- Application components must be shared across the NICS.

## 1.2 - Include business continuity into planning and decision making

#### Description

Define and maintain a set NICS processes and activities that can be invoked in the event
of interruptions always keeping business continuity top of mind.

#### Rationale

The rise in cyber-attacks, the rapidly changing technical landscape and an increased dependency on technology
means that the NICS faces uncertainty and change. Consequently, we must ensure business critical activities
are able to continue to function despite internal and external events. We must apply a risk/ impact analysis to
our decision making and planning to ensure potential issues are planned for. As a result, specific organisational
alternative mechanisms will be required to manage these unexpected risks and their impacts.

#### Implications

Dependence on shared applications implies that business interruption risks must be expected and managed
in advance. Management includes, but is not limited to, periodic revisions, vulnerability and exposure tests, or
designing business critical services to ensure continuity through redundancies or alternative resources.

- Enterprise operations are maintained regardless of any system interruptions
- National Cyber Security Centre and the Security Policy Framework must be followed.
- Risk and impact analysis must be included within planning and decision making.
- Recoverability, redundancy, and maintenance must be approached at inception.
- Applications must be assessed regarding criticality and impact on the NICS to determine which continuity
level is required and which corresponding recovery plan must be implemented.
- Business resumption plans must be part of the overall business continuity strategy.
- Dependency on shared system applications mandates that the risks of business interruption must be
established in advance and managed.
- Management includes but is not limited to periodic reviews; testing for vulnerability and exposure; or
designing mission-critical services to ensure business function continuity through redundant or alternative
capabilities.
- Recoverability, redundancy, and maintainability should be addressed at the time of design.
- Applications must be assessed for criticality and impact on the NICS mission statement in order to
determine what level of continuity is required and what corresponding recovery plan is necessary.
- Metrics surrounding availability, operational and service level agreements must be mandated as part of the
design process.

## 1.3 - Adopt industry best practice

#### Description

Align information and technology activities to industry best practices in areas such as
processing, technology, governance and management.

#### Rationale

The NICS must always strive to adopt industry best practices in its business activities in order to enhance
service and project delivery and drive down costs.

#### Implications

Best practices information and technology disciplines must be identified, studied and implemented. These best
practice Information and Technology disciplines must:

- Be certifiable and use established metrics.
- Adopt continuous improvement and build this approach into management and governance processes.
- There must be an enterprise risk perspective, focused on no tolerance for failure and records of incidents
and events.
- The management of information and technology costs per service must be aligned with those of the
industry and commensurate to the organisation’s risk appetite.
- Information and technology management must be focused on indicators and a program perspective.
- Staff must be increasingly qualified and motivated.
- The established enterprise architecture must be effectively applied in projects.

## 1.4 - Reuse before buy, buy before build

#### Description

Avoid duplicating effort and unnecessary costs by collaborating across government and
sharing and reusing technology, data and services. Prior to acquiring new assets, the
NICS will reuse applicable existing information and technology assets. If no existing
internal asset is available for reuse, the preference is to acquire, by purchasing or
licensing, applicable externally available assets. The NICS least preferred option is to
custom build a new asset.

#### Rationale

Reusing information and technology assets (for example, automated systems or data) that are already available
is often the simplest, quickest, and least expensive solution, assuming that the assets in question sufficiently
fit the intended purpose. It is less expensive to buy standard technology solutions than to custom build them,
as long as they are not adapted and maintenance is left to the product supplier. Many authoritative data
sources make their data products available (or offer data acquisition/generation services), reducing the need to
generate such data. Custom development of assets is often very expensive to sustain.

#### Implications

When functionality is required, existing information and technology assets in the NICS must be evaluated and
used first, unless they do not exist and/or are a significant mismatch to the required functionality. The NICS must have a unified approach to:

- Identifying the business functions that are allowed to differ from industry standard practices in using NICS assets and commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions and determining the extent to which these functions are allowed to be different.
- To ensure that information and technology assets are being reused as much as possible, business areas must be prepared to adapt to existing solutions that provide adequate functionality, particularly in situations where the accountable governance body does not deem that business area’s practices to be required to be different from industry standard practices.
- The NICS will prefer COTS products and particularly those that are configurable. Some products are so configurable that there is little difference between extensive configuration and custom development. NICS must clearly understand when configuration equates to custom development (that is, the level of configuration is so high that the COTS solution is essentially the same as custom development). In these cases, the scenario will change from buy to build.
- Agreements or licenses to use data (i.e. data subscription services) may have legal implications and legal consultation should be part of the process of deciding to use a new data source.
- Information and Technology assets should only be custom developed as a last resort. That is, custom
development should be prevented as much as possible.
- NICS must be able to manage the life cycle of its IT assets, including its custom assets, and custom assets should be revisited periodically during their life cycle, to allow for reconsideration in case the custom asset should be replaced with an appropriate purchased alternative.
- The complexity of the integration effort will increases as the environment becomes more diversified with solutions that made available on-premise (internally developed or COTS) as well as externally hosted.
- Unnecessary diversity in information and technology assets and approaches to technology business
solutions must be minimized.
- Service catalogues must be maintained to ensure widespread awareness of the existing assets (data,
applications, services, APIs etc), their health and lifecycle status

## 1.5 - Common use applications

#### Description

Solutions that can be applied across the NICS are preferred to the development of
solutions which are only provided to a particular organisational unit.

#### Rationale

Duplicative capability is expensive and can result in the proliferation of conflicting data.

#### Implications

- Organisational units which depend on a capability which does not serve the entire NICS must change over to the replacement enterprise-wide capability. This will require establishment of and adherence to a policy requiring this.
- Organisational units will not be allowed to develop capabilities for their own use which duplicate
enterprise-wide capabilities. In this way, expenditures of scarce resources to develop essentially the same capability in marginally different ways will be reduced.
- Data and information used to support NICS decision-making will be standardised. This is because the
smaller, organisational capabilities which produced different data (which was not shared among other
organisation units) will be replaced by enterprise-wide capabilities. The impetus for adding to the set of enterprise-wide capabilities may well come from an organisational unit making a convincing case for the value of the data/information previously produced by its organisational capability, but the resulting capability will become part of the enterprise-wide system, and the data it produces will be shared across the enterprise.
- Ambiguities resulting from multiple insular definitions of data must give way to accepted NICS-wide
definitions and understanding.
- Multiple data standardisation initiatives need to be coordinated.
- Functional data administration responsibilities must be assigned.
- Where appropriate an NICS Single Sign-On (SSO) should be utilised alongside role based access control to
maintain data security.

## 1.6 - Deliver maximum benefits at the lowest cost and risks

#### Description

Strategic decisions for solutions must always strive to generate value for the NICS
enterprise as a whole, at the lowest long-term risks and costs.

#### Rationale

Decisions must not be made based solely on reaching lower solution costs. Every strategic decision must be assessed based on cost, risk, and benefit perspectives through a sound business case. Lower costs often represent greater risks, lower quality and, perhaps, fewer benefits. Decisions must provide maximum benefit to
 he whole NICS enterprise in order to maximise benefit to citizens.

#### Implications

- A solution must be selected based on an assessment of the qualitative or quantitative cost (ROI), its risk, and its business benefits.
- Most times, quantitative assessments are simpler based on a cost perspective but more complex for risks and even more intricate for benefits. The quantitative assessment must always be conducted whenever possible as it is a more tangible.
- A qualitative assessment of one or two perspectives is generally sufficient when a quantitative assessment is properly conducted and already leads to a decision.
- Operating risks must be quantified whenever possible.
- The technology infrastructure must also be optimised based on business requirements and technological capacity to generate lower costs and risks, thus benefiting the NICS.
- We will need to balance the portfolio of projects to include higher risk/reward initiatives at in an effort to ensure continued innovation.
- Achieving maximum enterprise-wide benefit will require changes in the way we plan and manage
information - technology alone will not bring about this change.
- Some organisations may have to concede their own preferences for the greater benefit of the entire
enterprise.
- Application development priorities must be established by the entire enterprise for the entire enterprise.
- Applications components should be shared across organisational boundaries.
- Information management initiatives should be conducted in accordance with the enterprise plan.
- Individual organisations should pursue information management initiatives which conform to the
blueprints and priorities established by the enterprise.

## 1.7 - Be open and use open source and open standards

#### Description

Publish your code and use open source software to improve transparency, flexibility
and accountability. Build technology that uses open standards to ensure your
technology works and communicates with other technology and can easily be
upgraded and expanded.

#### Rationale

Open source is a way of developing and distributing software. The code is often written collaboratively, and it
can be downloaded, used and changed by anyone.

Open standards are common rules that allow any user to create compatible and consistent products, processes
and services. They are designed collaboratively, are publicly available, and free or low cost.

Using open source and open standards allows your work to benefit from:

- solving common problems with readily available open source technology.
- saving time and resources for customised solutions to solve rare or unique problems.
- lower implementation and running costs.
- allowing open source and closed source (proprietary) software to work together.

Be aware that open source software is not completely free, so consider the total cost of migrating, including exit
and transition costs.

Publishing your code and data from the beginning will encourage:

- clearer documentation, making it easier for your team to maintain the code, track changes to it and for
other people to use it.
- cleaner and well-structured code that is easier to maintain.
- clarity around data that needs to remain protected and how that’s achieved.
- suggestions about how the code can be improved or where security can be improved.

#### Implications

- Application source code and clear developer documentation are required deliverables as well as the
application itself.
- All new application development code should use github as its source code. repository, whether coded by NICS developers or third-party developers.
- Great care must be taken when making source code open and reusable. Developers should refer to the
GDS Service Manual section on making source code open and reusable.
- There are times when it’s acceptable for code to be closed source. For example, keys and credentials, algorithms used to detect fraud, and unreleased policy.

## 1.8 - Protection of intellectual property

#### Description

The protection of the enterprise’s Intellectual Property (IP) must be reflected in the IT
architecture, implementation and governance processes.

#### Rationale

A major part of NICS’s IP is hosted in the IT domain.

#### Implications

- While protection of IP assets is everybody’s business, much of the actual protection is implemented in the IT domain. Even trust in non-IT processes can be managed by IT processes (email, mandatory notes, etc.)
- A security policy, governing human and IT actors, will be required that can substantially improve
protection of IP. This must be capable of both avoiding compromises and reducing liabilities.
