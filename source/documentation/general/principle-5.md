## 5. Common use applications

### Description

Solutions that can be applied across the NICS are preferred to the development of
solutions which are only provided to a particular organisational unit.

### Rationale

Duplicative capability is expensive and can result in the proliferation of conflicting data.

### Implications

- Organisational units which depend on a capability which does not serve the entire NICS must change over to the replacement enterprise-wide capability. This will require establishment of and adherence to a policy requiring this.
- Organisational units will not be allowed to develop capabilities for their own use which duplicate
enterprise-wide capabilities. In this way, expenditures of scarce resources to develop essentially the same capability in marginally different ways will be reduced.
- Data and information used to support NICS decision-making will be standardised. This is because the
smaller, organisational capabilities which produced different data (which was not shared among other
organisation units) will be replaced by enterprise-wide capabilities. The impetus for adding to the set of enterprise-wide capabilities may well come from an organisational unit making a convincing case for the value of the data/information previously produced by its organisational capability, but the resulting capability will become part of the enterprise-wide system, and the data it produces will be shared across the enterprise.
- Ambiguities resulting from multiple insular definitions of data must give way to accepted NICS-wide
definitions and understanding.
- Multiple data standardisation initiatives need to be coordinated.
- Functional data administration responsibilities must be assigned.
- Where appropriate an NICS Single Sign-On (SSO) should be utilised alongside role based access control to
maintain data security.
