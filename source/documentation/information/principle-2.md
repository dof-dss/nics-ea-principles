## 2. Make information accessible, shareable and consumable

### Description

Business lines have access to information that is necessary for performance of their
respective mandates. Therefore, information is shared between different business lines and
positions, depending on the security levels established for that particular set of information.

### Rationale

Access to accurate information is essential to improve the quality and efficiency of the decision-making, low response turnaround time for information requests and delivery. It is less expensive to maintain timely and accurate information in a single repository and share that than to maintain repetitive information in multiple sources.

Shared information from a centralised authoritative source promotes better decisions-making, cost efficiencies, accuracy and better governance of information.

### Implications

- To enable data sharing we must develop and abide by a common set of policies, procedures, and standardsgoverning data management, discovery and access for both the short and the long term.
- Data should be defined consistently throughout the enterprise, using definitions that are understandable and available to all users. This can be achieved by developing and maintaining an enterprise data dictionary.
- We will also need to develop standard data models, data elements, and other metadata that defines this shared environment and develop a repository system for storing this metadata to make it accessible.
- For the short term, to preserve our significant investment in legacy systems, we must invest in software capable of migrating legacy system data into a shared data environment.
- For the long term, as legacy systems are replaced, we must adopt and enforce common data access policies and guidelines for new application developers to ensure that data in new applications remains available for sharing
- To enable information sharing, a common set of policies, procedures, and standards (i.e. definitions) must be developed and followed as part of the governance of information.
- Normalised data models and metadata that define such shared environments must be developed, in
addition to a repository to store the metadata and make it accessible.
- As existing systems are replaced, common information access and developer guidelines must be adopted and implemented to ensure that all information in new applications remains available in the shared environment.
- In both short and long-term, common methods and tools to create, maintain, and access shared
information must be adopted across the NICS.
- Information sharing implies a significant cultural shift and will be the focus of the Information Governance initiative.
- The information-sharing principle is constantly confronted with the information security principle.
Information sharing must not compromise the confidentiality of information under any circumstance.
- Shared information must be used by all collaborators to perform their respective tasks while respecting accountability for the source of information. This ensures that only the most up-to-date and accurate information is used in the decision-making process. Shared information shall become the only virtual source of NICS information.
- The manner in which information is accessed and made available must be sufficiently flexible to satisfy a wide array of NICS beneficiaries and their respective access methods and use.
