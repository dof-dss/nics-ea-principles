# Information Principles

## 2.1 - Treat information as a NICS asset

### Description

Information is a valuable asset to the NICS and must be managed accordingly
through its life cycle. All organisations in the NICS need to participate in information
management decisions to accomplish business objectives. This implies a need to plan
for the strategic use of information to enable differentiating business capabilities.

### Rationale

Information represents a valuable NICS resource, with actual and measurable value. Information is the basis
of the decision-making process. Therefore, it must be carefully managed to ensure constant awareness of its
location, reliability of its contents, and access whenever and wherever necessary.

In order to ensure information management is aligned with the business, all organisations in the NICS must be
involved in all aspects of the information environment. The business experts from across the enterprise and the
technical staff responsible for developing and sustaining the information environment need to come together
as a team to jointly define the goals and objectives of IT.

### Implications

- To operate as a team, every stakeholder, or customer, will need to accept responsibility for developing the
information environment.
- Information management processes and a governance model must be implemented with appropriate KPI’s.
- An enterprise information architecture will be required to provide a holistic view of the NICS’s information
and its opportunities for reuse.
- Information risks and compliance will need to be assessed as a continuous process.
- Awareness of the business value of information must be clearly communicated.
- Information-related policies (i.e. privacy by design) and standards should be followed.
- Commitment of resources will be required to implement this principle.

## 2.2 - Make information accessible, shareable and consumable

### Description

Business lines have access to information that is necessary for performance of their
respective mandates. Therefore, information is shared between different business lines and
positions, depending on the security levels established for that particular set of information.

### Rationale

Access to accurate information is essential to improve the quality and efficiency of the decision-making, low response turnaround time for information requests and delivery. It is less expensive to maintain timely and accurate information in a single repository and share that than to maintain repetitive information in multiple sources.

Shared information from a centralised authoritative source promotes better decisions-making, cost efficiencies, accuracy and better governance of information.

### Implications

- To enable data sharing we must develop and abide by a common set of policies, procedures, and standardsgoverning data management, discovery and access for both the short and the long term.
- Data should be defined consistently throughout the enterprise, using definitions that are understandable and available to all users. This can be achieved by developing and maintaining an enterprise data dictionary.
- We will also need to develop standard data models, data elements, and other metadata that defines this shared environment and develop a repository system for storing this metadata to make it accessible.
- For the short term, to preserve our significant investment in legacy systems, we must invest in software capable of migrating legacy system data into a shared data environment.
- For the long term, as legacy systems are replaced, we must adopt and enforce common data access policies and guidelines for new application developers to ensure that data in new applications remains available for sharing
- To enable information sharing, a common set of policies, procedures, and standards (i.e. definitions) must be developed and followed as part of the governance of information.
- Normalised data models and metadata that define such shared environments must be developed, in
addition to a repository to store the metadata and make it accessible.
- As existing systems are replaced, common information access and developer guidelines must be adopted and implemented to ensure that all information in new applications remains available in the shared environment.
- In both short and long-term, common methods and tools to create, maintain, and access shared
information must be adopted across the NICS.
- Information sharing implies a significant cultural shift and will be the focus of the Information Governance initiative.
- The information-sharing principle is constantly confronted with the information security principle.
Information sharing must not compromise the confidentiality of information under any circumstance.
- Shared information must be used by all collaborators to perform their respective tasks while respecting accountability for the source of information. This ensures that only the most up-to-date and accurate information is used in the decision-making process. Shared information shall become the only virtual source of NICS information.
- The manner in which information is accessed and made available must be sufficiently flexible to satisfy a wide array of NICS beneficiaries and their respective access methods and use.

## 2.3  Use common terminology and definitions

### Description

Define structured and unstructured information consistently and coherently throughout
theNICS through comprehensible and accessible definition by staff.

### Rationale

The information used in the development of applications must have a common definition so that the
information can be shared. A common terminology facilitates communication and promotes efficient dialog and
allows information and interfaces to be shared among different systems.

### Implications

- NICS must first establish a common terminology for business activities. Such definitions must be uniformly used throughout the enterprise.
- Whenever a new data definition is required, efforts regarding such definition must be coordinated and reconciled within a NICS data description “glossary.” The Information Asset Owners need to be responsible for such coordination.
- Ambiguities arising from multiple data definitions must be replaced by a definition that is accepted and understood across business lines.
- A dedicated effort will be required to achieve common terminology and definitions.
