## 1. Treat information as a NICS asset

### Description

Information is a valuable asset to the NICS and must be managed accordingly
through its life cycle. All organisations in the NICS need to participate in information
management decisions to accomplish business objectives. This implies a need to plan
for the strategic use of information to enable differentiating business capabilities.

### Rationale

Information represents a valuable NICS resource, with actual and measurable value. Information is the basis
of the decision-making process. Therefore, it must be carefully managed to ensure constant awareness of its
location, reliability of its contents, and access whenever and wherever necessary.

In order to ensure information management is aligned with the business, all organisations in the NICS must be
involved in all aspects of the information environment. The business experts from across the enterprise and the
technical staff responsible for developing and sustaining the information environment need to come together
as a team to jointly define the goals and objectives of IT.

### Implications

- To operate as a team, every stakeholder, or customer, will need to accept responsibility for developing the
information environment.
- Information management processes and a governance model must be implemented with appropriate KPI’s.
- An enterprise information architecture will be required to provide a holistic view of the NICS’s information
and its opportunities for reuse.
- Information risks and compliance will need to be assessed as a continuous process.
- Awareness of the business value of information must be clearly communicated.
- Information-related policies (i.e. privacy by design) and standards should be followed.
- Commitment of resources will be required to implement this principle.
