## 3. Use common terminology and definitions

### Description

Define structured and unstructured information consistently and coherently throughout
theNICS through comprehensible and accessible definition by staff.

### Rationale

The information used in the development of applications must have a common definition so that the
information can be shared. A common terminology facilitates communication and promotes efficient dialog and
allows information and interfaces to be shared among different systems.

### Implications

- NICS must first establish a common terminology for business activities. Such definitions must be uniformly used throughout the enterprise.
- Whenever a new data definition is required, efforts regarding such definition must be coordinated and reconciled within a NICS data description “glossary.” The Information Asset Owners need to be responsible for such coordination.
- Ambiguities arising from multiple data definitions must be replaced by a definition that is accepted and understood across business lines.
- A dedicated effort will be required to achieve common terminology and definitions.
