## 2. Control technical diversity

### Description

Technological diversity is controlled to minimize significant costs related to the
maintenance of expertise and connectivity between several different processing
environments.

### Rationale

There is a real and significant cost related to the infrastructure required to support alternative technologies for processing environments. There are other infrastructure costs to maintain the architecture of multiple interconnected processors.

Limiting the number of supported components simplifies and reduces maintenance and management costs.

A smaller number of software packages represent a greater ease and lower integration costs.
Business advantages of minimum technical diversity include:

- Standard Component Packaging
- Predictable Implementation Impact
- Predictable returns and validations
- Defined tests
- Greater flexibility to accommodate technological advances

### Implications

- Policies, standards, and procedures that regulate the acquisition of technology or contracting with new suppliers must be directly bound to this principle.
- Technology decisions are guided by the business and technology blueprints.
- Procedures to increase the set of acceptable technologies to meet evolved requirements must be
developed and implemented.
- In some cases, this will imply working closely with the procurement group to develop appropriate
justifications.
- This principle does not require freezing the technological baseline. Technological advances are welcome and included into the technological blueprint when they are compatible with current infrastructures, are likely to improve operating efficiency, or there is a need to increase capacity.
