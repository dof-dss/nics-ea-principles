## 3. Use a risk-based approach to security

### Description

Create a consistent and effective risk assessment approach to information
and technology assets as well as an engagement model that is aligned with the
information and technology risk framework. This process will enable a
pragmatic approach to managing risk and security.

### Rationale

Risk is the likelihood of something happening that will have an impact on the NICSâ€™s objectives and risk assessment is the overall process of risk identification, analysis, evaluation, mitigation and acceptance of residual risks that are within our defined risk tolerance.

Taking a risk-based approach allows for:
- better identification of threats to our projects, operations, existing systems and information
- more effective allocation and use of resources to manage those risks
- improved stakeholder confidence and trust as we better manage information and business risks

### Implications

- The level and cost of information security controls to manage confidentiality, integrity and availability risks must be appropriate and proportionate to the value of the information assets and the potential severity, probability, and the extent of harm.
- Risks must be identified so that we are aware of the likelihood, the consequence should the risk occur, what existing controls are in place, and a determination is made as to how to treat the risks.
- Options for addressing information risk should be reviewed so that informed and documented decisions
are made in regard to the treatment of the risk. Risk treatment involves choosing one or more options,
which typically include:
- Accepting the risk (implies that the risk is tolerated based on factors such as low severity or low probability of occurring)
- Avoiding the risk (implies that a risk can be avoided by not
pursuing an option or course of action)
- Transferring the risk (implies that the risk can be transferred to an external entity that is better suited to handle such a risk - i.e. outsourcing)
- Mitigating the risk (implies that cost effective measures can be applied to either eliminate or reduce its impact or likelihood to an acceptable level of tolerance)
