# Technology and Security Principles

## 4.1 - Implement changes based on requirements

#### Description

Changes in applications and technologies are implemented to meet business needs.

#### Rationale

This principle promotes an atmosphere where the information and technology environment changes to
reflect business needs, rather than changing the business to reflect technology changes. This ensures a focus on business operations as the basis for any change proposal while respecting all other guiding principles. In an effort to stay current with the evolution of technology, technology changes can generate opportunities to improve business functionality and processes thereby bringing significant value.

Involuntary effects on businesses resulting from technology changes are mitigated.

#### Implications

- Changes in implementation follow a complete assessment of proposed changes, based on the enterprise
architecture.
- A system development or technical improvement is not implemented unless there is a documented
business need.
- A business need must be considered, but it must also be aligned with other enterprise architecture
principles. There must be a balance between business needs and IT operations.

## 4.2 - Control technical diversity

#### Description

Technological diversity is controlled to minimize significant costs related to the
maintenance of expertise and connectivity between several different processing
environments.

#### Rationale

There is a real and significant cost related to the infrastructure required to support alternative technologies for processing environments. There are other infrastructure costs to maintain the architecture of multiple interconnected processors.

Limiting the number of supported components simplifies and reduces maintenance and management costs.

A smaller number of software packages represent a greater ease and lower integration costs.
Business advantages of minimum technical diversity include:

- Standard Component Packaging
- Predictable Implementation Impact
- Predictable returns and validations
- Defined tests
- Greater flexibility to accommodate technological advances

#### Implications

- Policies, standards, and procedures that regulate the acquisition of technology or contracting with new suppliers must be directly bound to this principle.
- Technology decisions are guided by the business and technology blueprints.
- Procedures to increase the set of acceptable technologies to meet evolved requirements must be
developed and implemented.
- In some cases, this will imply working closely with the procurement group to develop appropriate
justifications.
- This principle does not require freezing the technological baseline. Technological advances are welcome and included into the technological blueprint when they are compatible with current infrastructures, are likely to improve operating efficiency, or there is a need to increase capacity.

## 4.3 - Use a risk-based approach to security

#### Description

Create a consistent and effective risk assessment approach to information
and technology assets as well as an engagement model that is aligned with the
information and technology risk framework. This process will enable a
pragmatic approach to managing risk and security.

#### Rationale

Risk is the likelihood of something happening that will have an impact on the NICSâ€™s objectives and risk assessment is the overall process of risk identification, analysis, evaluation, mitigation and acceptance of residual risks that are within our defined risk tolerance.

Taking a risk-based approach allows for:
- better identification of threats to our projects, operations, existing systems and information
- more effective allocation and use of resources to manage those risks
- improved stakeholder confidence and trust as we better manage information and business risks

#### Implications

- The level and cost of information security controls to manage confidentiality, integrity and availability risks must be appropriate and proportionate to the value of the information assets and the potential severity, probability, and the extent of harm.
- Risks must be identified so that we are aware of the likelihood, the consequence should the risk occur, what existing controls are in place, and a determination is made as to how to treat the risks.
- Options for addressing information risk should be reviewed so that informed and documented decisions
are made in regard to the treatment of the risk. Risk treatment involves choosing one or more options,
which typically include:
- Accepting the risk (implies that the risk is tolerated based on factors such as low severity or low probability of occurring)
- Avoiding the risk (implies that a risk can be avoided by not
pursuing an option or course of action)
- Transferring the risk (implies that the risk can be transferred to an external entity that is better suited to handle such a risk - i.e. outsourcing)
- Mitigating the risk (implies that cost effective measures can be applied to either eliminate or reduce its impact or likelihood to an acceptable level of tolerance)

## 4.4 - Design solutions with security in mind

#### Description

Controls for the protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability of data must
be designed into all aspects of solutions from initiation, not as an afterthought.

Security and privacy should be designed into the business processes within which a
technology solution will be used.

#### Rationale

The implementation of protections for confidentiality, availability and integrity within information systems later in a project (or after its implementation) is more expensive than including security protections within the initial design of the solution. Such controls implemented at the end of a project are often less efficient and less integrated than those integrated within the core of the solution.

Because of its broad mandate, the NICS is a steward of public and private data assets, which must be protected, both from a legal and regulatory perspective as well as from a good steward/risk management perspective. Citizens and staff must be able to trust services provided by the NICS.

#### Implications

- Security is imbedded as an integral part of the solution architecture, not added as an afterthought.
- Security mechanisms must be scalable and span all tiers of the architecture, including the design and functionality of solutions.
- All solutions, custom or commercial, must be tested to ensure that security requirements are met.
- Possible areas of control which could be addressed and integrated include (but are not limited to):
  - asset management and information classification
  - physical security
  - segregation of duties
  - protection against malicious code
  - back-up and recovery
  - exchange of information
  - logging and monitoring
  - user authentication and authorisation
  - technical vulnerability management
  - compliance with legal requirements
  - system control audit considerations
- A set of requirements are developed for alignment with the principles expressed herein as these relate specifically to information security.
- Refer to and follow Make privacy integral guidance when designing solutions.
- Cloud hosted services should follow the [NCSC Security Principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security?curPage=/collection/cloud-security/implementing-the-cloud-security-principles).

## 4.5 - Leveraging multi cloud provision

#### Description

Using both public and private cloud technologies deliver scalable and secure solutions at pace.

#### Rationale

To modernise the approach of building and hosting Government solutions, gain benefits of on-demand
infrastructure provisioning and scalability and have a ready-made platform as a service component public cloud hosting should be the default choice.

#### Implications

When architecting and designing solutions to support citizen services delivery:

- Public cloud technologies and the hosting approach should be considered the default position;
- Hybrid solutions leveraging Public/Private/Hybrid cloud are permissible subject to approval
- When procuring solutions, consideration of Public/Private/Hybrid cloud should take place early in the process i.e. at commissioning stage or Outline Business Case and be agreed by ITDA.
