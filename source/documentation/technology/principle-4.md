## 4. Design solutions with security in mind

### Description

Controls for the protection of confidentiality, integrity and availability of data must
be designed into all aspects of solutions from initiation, not as an afterthought.

Security and privacy should be designed into the business processes within which a
technology solution will be used.

### Rationale

The implementation of protections for confidentiality, availability and integrity within information systems later in a project (or after its implementation) is more expensive than including security protections within the initial design of the solution. Such controls implemented at the end of a project are often less efficient and less integrated than those integrated within the core of the solution.

Because of its broad mandate, the NICS is a steward of public and private data assets, which must be protected, both from a legal and regulatory perspective as well as from a good steward/risk management perspective. Citizens and staff must be able to trust services provided by the NICS.

### Implications

- Security is imbedded as an integral part of the solution architecture, not added as an afterthought.
- Security mechanisms must be scalable and span all tiers of the architecture, including the design and functionality of solutions.
- All solutions, custom or commercial, must be tested to ensure that security requirements are met.
- Possible areas of control which could be addressed and integrated include (but are not limited to):
  - asset management and information classification
  - physical security
  - segregation of duties
  - protection against malicious code
  - back-up and recovery
  - exchange of information
  - logging and monitoring
  - user authentication and authorisation
  - technical vulnerability management
  - compliance with legal requirements
  - system control audit considerations
- A set of requirements are developed for alignment with the principles expressed herein as these relate specifically to information security.
- Refer to and follow Make privacy integral guidance when designing solutions.
- Cloud hosted services should follow the [NCSC Security Principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security?curPage=/collection/cloud-security/implementing-the-cloud-security-principles).
