## 5. Leveraging multi cloud provision

### Description

Using both public and private cloud technologies deliver scalable and secure solutions at pace.

### Rationale

To modernise the approach of building and hosting Government solutions, gain benefits of on-demand
infrastructure provisioning and scalability and have a ready-made platform as a service component public cloud hosting should be the default choice.

### Implications

When architecting and designing solutions to support citizen services delivery:

- Public cloud technologies and the hosting approach should be considered the default position;
- Hybrid solutions leveraging Public/Private/Hybrid cloud are permissible subject to approval
- When procuring solutions, consideration of Public/Private/Hybrid cloud should take place early in the process i.e. at commissioning stage or Outline Business Case and be agreed by ITDA.
