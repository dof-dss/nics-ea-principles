## 1. Implement changes based on requirements

### Description

Changes in applications and technologies are implemented to meet business needs.

### Rationale

This principle promotes an atmosphere where the information and technology environment changes to
reflect business needs, rather than changing the business to reflect technology changes. This ensures a focus on business operations as the basis for any change proposal while respecting all other guiding principles. In an effort to stay current with the evolution of technology, technology changes can generate opportunities to improve business functionality and processes thereby bringing significant value.

Involuntary effects on businesses resulting from technology changes are mitigated.

### Implications

- Changes in implementation follow a complete assessment of proposed changes, based on the enterprise
architecture.
- A system development or technical improvement is not implemented unless there is a documented
business need.
- A business need must be considered, but it must also be aligned with other enterprise architecture
principles. There must be a balance between business needs and IT operations.
