# Enterprise Architecture Principles

Principles are basically high-level definitions of fundamental values that guide both business and technology decisions,
serving as the basis for architecture development, policies, and standards. Each architecture principle must focus mainly on business goals and the implications for the [Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS)](#definitions).

This document is based on and contains extracts from the [NICS Enterprise Architecture Principles](https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/publications/nics-enterprise-architecture-principles-itda).

## Categories of principles

We have chosen a set of Enterprise Architecture guiding principles organised into four categories:

1. [General Principles](#general-principles)
2. [Information Principles](#information-principles)
3. [Application Principles](#application-principles)
4. [Technology and Security Principles](#technology-and-security-principles)

5. [Common se applications](documentation/general#1-5-common-use-applications)
6. [Deliver maximum benefits at the lowest cost and risks](documentation/general#1-6-deliver-maximum-benefits-at-the-lowest-cost-and-risks)

4. [Implement service based interfaces](documentation/application#3-4-implement-service-based-interfaces)
5. [Adhere to functional domains](documentation/application#3-5-adhere-to-functional-domains)

## Definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following definitions will apply:

**Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS)**

The nine (9) core departments making up the Northern Ireland Civil Service (Agriculture, Environment & Rural
Affairs (DAERA), Infrastructure (DfI), Economy (DfE), Education (DE), Finance (DoF), Health (DoH), Justice (DoJ),
Executive Office (TEO) and Communities (DfC)) and any other Northern Ireland Public Sector organisation either
funded by any of these departments OR taking digital or IT services from any of these departments.

**Private Cloud**

Private cloud refers to a model of cloud computing where IT services are provisioned over private IT
infrastructure for the dedicated use of a single organisation.

**Public Cloud**

The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet.
