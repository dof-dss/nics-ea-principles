# NICS Enterprise Architecture Principles

## Introduction

This document is based on and contains extracts from the [NICS Enterprise Architecture Principles](https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/publications/nics-enterprise-architecture-principles-itda).

### Definition

Principles are basically high-level definitions of fundamental values that guide both business and technology decisions,
serving as the basis for architecture development, policies, and standards. The principles of EA define general rules
and guidelines to use and implement with all Information and Technology resources and assets throughout the NICS. They must reflect a level of consensus between Departments, constituting the basis for current and future decisions regarding NICS business and technology direction.

Each architecture principle must focus mainly on business goals and the implications for the NICS.
