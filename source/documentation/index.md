# Enterprise Architecture Principles

Principles are basically high-level definitions of fundamental values that guide both business and technology decisions,
serving as the basis for architecture development, policies, and standards. Each architecture principle must focus mainly on business goals and the implications for the **Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS)**.

This document is based on and contains extracts from the [NICS Enterprise Architecture Principles](https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/publications/nics-enterprise-architecture-principles-itda).
