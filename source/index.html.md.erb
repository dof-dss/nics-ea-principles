# Enterprise Architecture Principles

Principles are basically high-level definitions of fundamental values that guide both business and technology decisions,
serving as the basis for architecture development, policies, and standards. Each architecture principle must focus mainly on business goals and the implications for the [Northern Ireland Civil Service](#definitions).

The information presented here is based on and contains extracts from the [NICS Enterprise Architecture Principles](https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/publications/nics-enterprise-architecture-principles-itda) document.

## Categories of principles

We have chosen a set of Enterprise Architecture guiding principles organised into four categories:

1. [General Principles](#1-general-principles)
2. [Information Principles](#2-information-principles)
3. [Application Principles](#3-application-principles)
4. [Technology and Security Principles](#4-technology-and-security-principles)

## 1. General Principles

| Ref | Classification | Principle |
| --- | -------------- | --------- |
| [1.1][1] | General | These principles will apply to all organisational units within the NICS  |
| [1.2][2] | General | Include business continuity into planning and decision making |
| [1.3][3] | General | Adopt industry best practice |
| [1.4][4] | General | Reuse before buy, buy before build |
| [1.5][5] | General | Common use applications |
| [1.6][6] | General | Deliver maximum benefits at the lowest cost and risks |
| [1.7][7] | General | Be open and use open source and open standards |
| [1.8][8] | General | Protection of intellectual property |

## 2. Information Principles

| Ref | Classification | Principle |
| --- | -------------- | --------- |
| [2.1][9] | Information | Treat information as a NICS asset |
| [2.2][10] | Information | Make information accessible, shareable and consumable |
| [2.3][11] | Information | Use common terminology and definitions |

## 3. Application Principles

| Ref | Classification | Principle |
| --- | -------------- | --------- |
| [3.1][12] | Application | Design simple and easy to use applications |
| [3.2][13] | Application | Align with Enterprise Architecture |
| [3.3][14] | Application | Apply Enterprise Architecture to externally hosted applications |
| [3.4][15] | Application | Implement service based interfaces |
| [3.5][16] | Application | Adhere to functional domains |
| [3.6][17] | Application | Application independence |
| [3.7][18] | Application | Component reusability |
| [3.8][19] | Application | Cloud-native applications |

## 4. Technology and Security Principles

| Ref | Classification | Principle |
| --- | -------------- | --------- |
| [4.1][20] | Technology | Implement changes based on requirements |
| [4.2][21] | Technology | Control technical diversity |
| [4.3][22] | Technology | Use a risk based approach to security |
| [4.4][23] | Technology | Design solutions with security in mind |
| [4.5][24] | Technology | Leveraging multi-cloud provision |

## Definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following definitions will apply:

**Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS)**

The nine (9) core departments making up the Northern Ireland Civil Service, that is:

- Agriculture, Environment & Rural Affairs (DAERA)
- Infrastructure (DfI)
- Economy (DfE)
- Education (DE)
- Finance (DoF)
- Health (DoH)
- Justice (DoJ),
- Executive Office (TEO)
- Communities (DfC)

and any other Northern Ireland Public Sector organisation either funded by any of these departments or taking digital or IT services from any of these departments.

**Private Cloud**

Private cloud refers to a model of cloud computing where IT services are provisioned over private IT
infrastructure for the dedicated use of a single organisation.

**Public Cloud**

The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet.
