# Enterprise Architecture Principles

Principles are basically high-level definitions of fundamental values that guide both business and technology decisions,
serving as the basis for architecture development, policies, and standards. Each architecture principle must focus mainly on business goals and the implications for the [Northern Ireland Civil Service](#definitions).

The information presented here is based on and contains extracts from the [NICS Enterprise Architecture Principles](https://www.finance-ni.gov.uk/publications/nics-enterprise-architecture-principles-itda) document.

## Definitions

For the purposes of this document, the following definitions will apply:

**Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS)**

The nine (9) core departments making up the Northern Ireland Civil Service, that is:

- Agriculture, Environment & Rural Affairs (DAERA)
- Infrastructure (DfI)

- Education (DE)
- Finance (DoF)
- Health (DoH)
- Justice (DoJ),
- Executive Office (TEO)
- Communities (DfC)

and any other Northern Ireland Public Sector organisation either funded by any of these departments or taking digital or IT services from any of these departments.

**Private Cloud**

Private cloud refers to a model of cloud computing where IT services are provisioned over private IT
infrastructure for the dedicated use of a single organisation.
